Welcome to the `Drölfundzwünfzig` secret laboratory. Please be careful with the
equipment that is lying around.

If you experience dizzyness, please consult your local teddy bear for a hug as
you might be allergic to laz0r cannons or `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
(in which case we also advise you to chew a few curly brackets while cuddling).

What Is This Pewpewlaz0rt4nk?
=============================

With the `Pewpewlaz0rt4nk` you can write simple HTTP requests and send them to
an HTTP server.

The HTTP response will then be compared with an expected HTTP response provided
by you.

If both responses match, the test passes. Otherwise... well, it fails.

We call this the `Pewpewlaz0rt4nk` because you can (possibly) crash your
friend's server and laugh at them diabolically.

Requirements
============

To use the `Pewpewlaz0rt4nk` you need to install
`Python 2 or 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and an HTTP server
(obviously). Unless you have a very good excuse why you want to use Python 2,
go for Python 3. If you're new to Python and you want to `learn the language
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_, go for Python 3 or be forever known as
a blockhead.
